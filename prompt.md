# HF-Modal-ModelScope Migration Plugin — Dev Session

Spec: `SPEC.md` | Status: `SPEC.md` § Development Phases

## Loop

1. **Read** — Open `SPEC.md` § Development Phases. Find the next unchecked `- [ ]` phase. Read spec sections relevant to that phase (architecture, file structure, implementation details, algorithm — whatever applies).
2. **Ask** — If anything is ambiguous or underspecified for this phase, ask via AskUserQuestion. Do not ask what the spec already answers.
3. **Plan** — Enter Plan Mode. Create implementation plan with file paths, code patterns, and test coverage.
4. **Work** — Execute the plan. Run tests and lint.
5. **Compound** — Update `SPEC.md`: check off completed items `- [x]`, add discoveries to **Open Questions** (status: Resolved). If new constraints found, add to `CLAUDE.md` § Key Constraints.
6. **Report** — Summarize: what was done, what's next, open questions needing input.
